## REST API implementation with [Spring](http://spring.io)


This is a very simple implementation of REST API (ish) in java using the Spring Web Framework.

* Some request examples can be found in the **docs** folder.

* You must have **direnv** installed in order to have the environment variables exported.

* You should install the [.env files support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9525--env-files-support) IDEA extension installed in order for the IDE to support the use of environment variables.
